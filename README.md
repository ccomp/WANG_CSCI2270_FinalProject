# WANG_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Phase 1:

Description: For our final project we have decided to make poker (Jacks or better).

How to Run: In order to run our program the user must compile the FinalProject.cpp and poker.cpp in C++11 (in terminal type g++ -std=c++11 FinalProject.cpp poker.cpp). Then run the code by typing ".a/.out" into the terminal directly after the code is compiled. Resize terminal window to largest size.

Dependancies: The terminal window must be atleast 80x24. The system must be a mac and have an up-to-date terminal with the g++ libraries installed.

System Requirements: This program will work on Mac. The system will also require terminal and be able to run c++.
